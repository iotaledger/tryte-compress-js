# IOTA Compress

IOTA Trytes compression/decompression provides a mechanism by which trytes can be more efficiently stored or transmitted.

By considering the data domain and the specific way in which tryte data is used we created an algorithm that works extremely efficiently in the most common use cases. The algorithm is also implemented in such a way as to make it lightweight enough to be used by embedded devices.

The algorithm uses a combination of run-length-encoding and huffman encoding based on a static huffman tree. The static huffman tree was generated by analyzing 10000s of actual transactions.

## Installing

Install this package using the following commands:

```shell
npm install @iota/compress
```

or

```shell
yarn add @iota/compress
```

## Example Usage

```js
const iotaCompress = require('@iota/compress');

const iotaCompress = require('../dist/iota-compress');

let trytes = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ9';
console.log('trytes', trytes);
console.log('trytes length', trytes.length);

let compressedBytes = iotaCompress.compress(trytes);
console.log('compressed', compressedBytes);
console.log('compressed length', compressedBytes.length);

let decompressed = iotaCompress.decompress(compressedBytes);
console.log('decompressed', decompressed);
console.log('matches', decompressed === trytes);

trytes = '9'.repeat(2673);
console.log('trytes', trytes);
console.log('trytes length', trytes.length);

compressedBytes = iotaCompress.compress(trytes);
console.log('compressed', compressedBytes);
console.log('compressed length', compressedBytes.length);

decompressed = iotaCompress.decompress(compressedBytes);
console.log('decompressed', decompressed);
console.log('matches', decompressed === trytes);
```

Will output:

```shell
trytes ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ9
trytes length 27
compressed <Buffer 4f 0f fb c9 62 f0 8c c3 9a ed 5a 2a 2d f6 6b 1c 60 00>

decompressed ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ9
matches true
trytes 9999999...999999999
trytes length 2673

decompressed 9999999...999999999

```

## API Reference

See the API reference for the Javascript implementation [here](./docs/api.md).

## Examples

To see the code in use there are some samples in the examples folder.

* [simple](./examples/simple/) - The example code show above.
* [huffmanTrainer](./examples/huffmanTrainer/) - The code which creates the static huffman tables by analyzing zmq stream.
* [random](./examples/random/) - Example processing random generated packets.
* [zmq](./examples/zmq/) - Example which monitors zmq stream and shows the potential compression ratios achieved with different algorithms.

## Results

The results of the current algorithm compared with some industry standard algorithms are shown below.

They were generated using the zmq example processing 10,000 transactions, these are the averages.
